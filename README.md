# 💡Car price prediction with Machine Learning - An AI project
#### 💡Project Objective
The objective of this project to generate the predictive outcomes of the car price for used vehicle. This projects will also validate my ability to develop and gain hands on experience in data science.
A Machine learning Models are developed from scratch in python for generating the prediction of the Car price. The Python ML Package that has been configured for generating prediction was SKlearn , Re-tuning and optimisation of Algorithms was performed for generating better outcomes.
###### ⚙️Evaluation 
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
The evaluation are done on the root mean squared error. RMSE is defined as:

RMSE=$(1N∑i=1N(yi−yˆi)2)12   
$$\left({1\N}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(yi-y^i\right)^2 \right)^{1\2}$$

where
yˆi is the predicted value
yi is the original value for each instance i.

#### 💡Data Collection
##### 🔦Objective: Gather and preprocess the data
The Data set is gathered from Kaggle skills assesments that was published for assessing the generating prediction with machine learning.The Data set is already cleaned and there are no errors in any of the observations , missing data or data with incorrect values has been already treated and incosistency has been removed.
