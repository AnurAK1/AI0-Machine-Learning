# ðŸ’¡Car Price prediction With Machine Learning Models - An AI project
A Machine learning Models are developed from scratch in python for generating the prediction of the Car price. The Python ML Package that has been configured for generating prediction was SKlearn , Re-tuning and optimisation of Algorithms was performed for generating better outcomes.
The Data set is cleaned and there are no errors in any of the observations , missing data or data with incorrect values has been already treated and incosistency has been removed.
