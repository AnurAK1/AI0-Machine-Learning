# ðŸ’¡Car Price prediction With Machine Learning Models - An AI project
A Machine learning Models are developed from scratch in python for generating the prediction of the Car price. The Python ML Package that has been configured for generating prediction was SKlearn , Re-tuning and optimisation of Algorithms was performed for generating better outcomes.

#### ðŸ’¡Data Collection
##### ðŸ”¦Objective: Gather and preprocess the data
The Data set is gathered from Kaggle skills assesments used car price data set that was published in website for assessing the participants.The Data set is already cleaned and there are no errors in any of the observations , missing data or data with incorrect values has been already treated and incosistency has been removed.
